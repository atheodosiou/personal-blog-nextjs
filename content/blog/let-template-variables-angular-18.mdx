Angular 18 introduces a powerful new feature: the `@let` directive. This directive simplifies your template logic by allowing you to declare variables directly within your HTML, making your Angular components cleaner and more maintainable.

## What is `@let`?

The `@let` directive allows you to define variables directly within your HTML templates, which can then be reused throughout the template. This feature is particularly useful for performing simple operations like string concatenation, calculations, or even handling asynchronous data streams with the `| async` pipe.

## Basic Usage

Here’s an example of how to use `@let`:

```html showLineNumbers
<div>
  @let greeting = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
  <h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>
</div>
```

In this example, we define a `greeting` variable that combines the string `"Hello, "` with a `name` variable, and then display it within an `<h1>` element.

## Practical Examples

### Calculating Total Prices

You can use `@let` to compute total prices in your template:

```html showLineNumbers
@for (product of products; track product.id) { @let totalPrice = product.price *
product.quantity;
<div>
  <p>{{ product.name }} - Total: {{ totalPrice | currency }}</p>
</div>
}
```

Here, `totalPrice` is calculated by multiplying `product.price` by `product.quantity`, and the result is formatted using the `currency` pipe.

### Formatting Dates

Format dates directly in your templates using `@let`:

```html showLineNumbers
@for (event of events; track event.id) { @let formattedDate = (new
Date(event.date)).toLocaleDateString();
<div>
  <p>{{ event.name }} - Date: {{ formattedDate }}</p>
</div>
}
```

This snippet converts each event's date into a human-readable format.

### Conditional Messages

Create conditional messages easily:

```html showLineNumbers
@for (user of users; track user.id) { @let statusMessage = user.isActive ?
'Active' : 'Inactive';
<div>
  <p>{{ user.name }} - Status: {{ statusMessage }}</p>
</div>
}
```

Here, the `statusMessage` variable is set based on the `user.isActive` condition.

## Advanced Usage: Handling Async Data

One of the most powerful uses of `@let` is in handling asynchronous data:

```html showLineNumbers
<div>
  @let data = (data$ | async); @let processedData = data ? data.map(item =>
  item.value) : [];
  <ul>
    @for (item of processedData; track item) {
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
    }
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example, `data$` is an observable that is handled cleanly within the template, with `@let` making the process straightforward and readable.

## Key Considerations

### Assignability

Unlike JavaScript’s `let`, Angular’s `@let` directive creates variables that cannot be reassigned within the template. However, their values are recomputed whenever Angular’s change detection runs.

```html showLineNumbers
@let value = 1;

<!-- This will cause an error -->
<button (click)="value = value + 1">Increment Value</button>
```

### Scope

Variables declared with `@let` are scoped to the current view and its descendants, which means they cannot be accessed by parent or sibling views.

```html showLineNumbers
@let topLevel = value;

<div>@let insideDiv = value;</div>

{{topLevel}}
<!-- Valid -->
{{insideDiv}}
<!-- Valid -->
```

## Conclusion

The `@let` directive is a valuable addition to Angular 18, making template logic simpler and more intuitive. By allowing direct variable declarations within your HTML templates, it reduces the need for complex and repetitive code, thereby improving both readability and maintainability. Use `@let` for straightforward operations, and keep more complex logic within your component's TypeScript code.
